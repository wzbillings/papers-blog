    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, I am unfortunately plagued by required reading, rather than\r\ncontinuing to attack my ‚Äúto-read‚Äù pile on my desk. I didn‚Äôt read these\r\npapers in complete detail, but rather skimmed over both of them.\r\n\r\nWoldu H et al., Applying functional data analysis to assess\r\ntele-interpersonal psychotherapy‚Äôs efficacy to reduce depression.\r\nJournal of Applied Statistics. 2019;46(2):203-216.\r\n\r\n\r\nYao F, M√ºller H, Wang J. Functional data analysis for sparse\r\nlongitudinal data. Journal of the American Statistical\r\nAssociation. 2005;100(470):577-590.\r\n\r\nSome background on why I need to read these! I‚Äôm currently taking a\r\ncourse on ‚ÄúAdvanced Biostatistics‚Äù which is essentially about reading\r\nbiostatistical literature and applying the concepts, rather than just\r\napplying things from textbooks. For my course project, I‚Äôm reanalyzing\r\nsome flu vaccine data (HAI titers over time) using functional data\r\nanalysis techniques rather than hierarchical linear models. The main\r\nhurdle with this is that I do not know anything about functional data\r\nanalysis, which is why I need to read about it. The first citation I‚Äôve\r\nlisted is by a former student in my program, who actually took the same\r\nclass as me, and is a pretty readable implementation of some FDA\r\nmethods. However, the data that I have are sparser than the data used in\r\nthis paper, so I also looked at the second citation to get an idea for\r\nwhat methods are appropriate for sparse longitudinal data (I only have\r\ntwo measurements per year).\r\nWhile I‚Äôm normally not a fan of really complicated frequentist\r\nmethods, there are a few points that I like about FDA enumerated in the\r\nWoldu paper. FDA doesn‚Äôt require specification of a covariance\r\nstructure, and also ‚Äúautomatically controls‚Äù for measurement error in a\r\nspecific way. HAI titers are known to be subjective, and especially when\r\nnot conducted with replicates, HAI data can often be subject to\r\nmeasurement error. FDA techniques deal with that by ‚Äúsmoothing‚Äù the\r\ndata‚Äìfrom the time series of observations, a smoothed curve is\r\nconstructed for analysis, typically using b-splines. This smoothing is\r\nthe first step where I think most FDA methods depart from reality‚Äìno\r\ntrue data generating process uses b-splines in the wild. But b-splines\r\nare often a good approximation of smooth patterns. Influenza\r\nstrain-specific serum antibody titer IS a ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù curve (of course no\r\nbiological curve is smooth if you look at a small enough time scale),\r\nand HAI titer is a discrete surrogate for antibody titer. Of course it\r\nisn‚Äôt a perfect measurement, but the literature does suggest that HAI\r\ntiter is a correlate for influenza protection, and it‚Äôs easier and\r\ncheaper than other assays. So I think that using a b-spline\r\napproximation to get smooth functions is ok.\r\nHowever, the second paper, on sparse data, says that although a\r\nformer paper suggested a type of mixed-effects model with a b-spline\r\nbasis for sparse longitudinal data, they ‚Äú[represented] the trajectories\r\ndirectly through the Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion.‚Äù I was hoping to avoid\r\ndealing with this, as I do not understand the KL expansion at all.\r\nNotably, they dislike the previous paper using bootstrap for pointwise\r\nconfidence intervals. I think the nonparametric bootstrap could probably\r\nbe used in a way to get a CI for the whole curve (either by resampling\r\nindividuals to include in the KL expansion or by resampling weights for\r\nthe expansion somehow), but I‚Äôm never convinced that parametric\r\nintervals are better than bootstrap. Particularly, some of the\r\nasymptotic results derived in this paper depend on assumptions of\r\nnormality ‚Äì I find this interesting as the Waldu paper claims that FDA\r\ntechniques do not require a normality assumption for random effects.\r\nMaybe this is only true for ‚Äúdense-enough‚Äù data.\r\nHowever, as I continued reading the second paper, this is when I\r\nbecame wary. The authors‚Äô proposed solution for functional data is PACE.\r\nPACE is capitalized throughout the paper, but I can‚Äôt figure out what it\r\nstands for. However, it is a type of functional principal components\r\nanalysis for sparse functional data. I do not like principal components\r\nand I will never like principal components. I think PCA is fine for\r\npredictive modeling where the explanations aren‚Äôt really relevant, but\r\nin exploratory and causal modeling, PCA is often a tool for avoiding\r\ncritical thinking. I think that in 99% of cases when applied, PCA\r\nprovides very little (if any) useful information. However, I don‚Äôt know\r\nthat much about functional PCA so maybe it will surprise me.\r\nThe rest of the first paper is a description of the methods used,\r\nfollowed by interpretation of the results. Essentially, the paper\r\napplies smoothing methods, functional PCA, and functional regression,\r\nwhich is essentially what I plan to do for my analysis. The authors of\r\nthe second paper have also written another paper:\r\n\r\nYao F, M√ºller H, Wang J. Functional linear regression analysis for\r\nlongitudinal data. The Annals of Statistics.\r\n2005;22(6):2873-2903.\r\n\r\nThis paper talks about functional regression methods extended to\r\nsparse functional data, so I guess I will need to glance over that paper\r\nas well. I would also be interested in finding more ‚Äúapplied‚Äù papers\r\nthat apply and interpret these papers, like the Woldu paper I read\r\ntoday. In addition to the PCA analysis, which Woldu interprets quite\r\nwell (well, as much as PCA can be interpreted), I want to try two\r\nregression methods. One method would be a functional response with\r\nnon-functional covariates, where the pre-vaccination and\r\npost-vaccination HAI titers are all included in the smoothed trajectory.\r\nI‚Äôd also like to try a function-on-function regression model, where the\r\npost-vaccination trajectories are used to create smoothed curves, which\r\ninclude a smoothed curve of the pre-vaccination trajectory (and also\r\nother covariates) as predictors.\r\nI‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the theory and methods in these\r\npapers in this post, like I said earlier I‚Äôm mostly skimming these to\r\nget an idea of what FDA is and how I can use it. After I changed my PhD\r\nconcentration to data analysis and modeling instead of biostatistics, I\r\ndon‚Äôt have to worry so much about theorems and lemmas anymore üòÅ. I also\r\nam trying to spend an hour or less on these posts per day, unless the\r\npaper is really important to my other current goals, so I guess that‚Äôs\r\nall I‚Äôll write about FDA. Hopefully I‚Äôll get to work on the actual\r\nanalysis soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nLast updated\r\n2022-04-11 10:21:27 EDT\r\nDetails\r\nsource\r\ncode, R\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I‚Äôve decided to work on that by attempting to read a paper a\r\nday. Every day when I come to the office, the first thing I will do is\r\nread a paper.\r\nI currently have a backlog of printed-out papers to read, so I‚Äôll try\r\nand get through those first unless something really catches my\r\nattention. I‚Äôll be as strict as I can, but some days I know I just won‚Äôt\r\nhave time (I run into a lot of time crunches recently‚Ä¶) and some days\r\nI‚Äôll probably read more than one paper. Maybe I‚Äôll make two blog posts\r\non those days.\r\nI read somewhere that one of the best ways to remember the take-home\r\npoints of a paper is to write down a summary with your thoughts\r\nimmediately after reading (and annotating!) the paper, so that was the\r\nimpetus for this blog.\r\nMaybe at some point I‚Äôll figure out how to set up comments on this\r\nblog (I bet Alison Hill has a blog post about how to do it) but for now,\r\nif you want to get in touch with me to tell me how much you love my blog\r\nor that I completely misinterpreted your paper, go back to my main site and get\r\nmy contact info there.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast updated\r\n2022-04-08 18:49:12 EDT\r\nDetails\r\nsource\r\ncode, R\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Zarnitsyna.\r\n‚ÄúInfluenza Immunization in the Context of Preexisting Immunity.‚Äù Cold\r\nSpring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine, September 28, 2020, a040964. https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a040964.\r\n\r\nMy main research focus right now is on how characteristics of\r\nindividuals and characteristics of virus strains can work together to\r\neffect the immune response to the seasonal flu vaccine, so this review\r\nis something I‚Äôve been meaning to get to for a while. I‚Äôve already read\r\na lot of the constituent citations, but at some point I plan to reread\r\nthem and input my thoughts here. Maybe it will help me remember them\r\nbetter.\r\nIn general, immunologists have pretty good proof that immunity to\r\ninfluenza is (at least partially) ‚Äúpath dependent.‚Äù The so-called\r\nimmune profile1 of an individual is\r\naffected by the strains of influenza they are exposed to, as one would\r\nlikely expect. An individual infected with a specific strain of\r\ninfluenza will likely have a memory immune response to that strain.\r\nHowever, an individual who is infected with H1N1 then H3N2 later will\r\nhave an immune profile that is quite different from an individual who is\r\ninfected with H3N2 then H1N1 later! In general, prior immunity to one\r\nstrain tends to shape the individual‚Äôs immune response to future\r\nstrains. This phenomenon is called ‚Äúoriginal antigenic sin‚Äù\r\nimmune imprinting.\r\nThe main conclusions supported by the review are: preexisting\r\nimmunity somehow inhibits the ability to mount an immune response to a\r\nnovel strain of the same pathogen; memory recall responses to conserved\r\nepitopes or that bind weakly to antigenically drifted epitopes are at\r\nleast partially responsible; preexisting antibody titers inhibit the\r\nmagnitude of the antibody response; high antibody titers for specific\r\nepitopes can lead to an immune response where another antibody is\r\nimmunodominant; and epitope masking, where antibody binding to antigen\r\ninhibits the activation of the memory B-cell response, is a potential\r\nexplanation for the boosting of responses to different epitopes.\r\nThe conclusions that preexisting immunity often inhibits the immune\r\nresponse to drifted flu strains, and that the memory B cell response is\r\na cause of this phenomenon were not new to me. Although I still don‚Äôt\r\nreally know what I‚Äôm talking about, I knew that clonal selection of\r\nB-cells leads to memory B cells with high affinity for antigen ‚Äì so\r\nsimilar antigens can activate the memory response, which makes mounting\r\na novel response more difficult. The relationship between fold change in\r\nantibodies and preexisting immunity is quite interesting to me ‚Äì I have\r\nbeen working with serological data where I see this exact pattern, and\r\npart of my current research is about this specific phenomenon. I think\r\nthe patterns of boosting and the explanation of epitope masking are\r\ninteresting, but like with all mathematical models, I think explicit\r\nbiological studies are necessary to confirm the findings. While the\r\nmathematical models which support epitope masking as an explanation for\r\nboosting to different epitopes are interesting, unless lab data can show\r\nthat epitope masking or steric hinderance is possible and actually\r\noccurring in this case, I‚Äôm not ready to believe that it is the sole\r\ncause of this phenomenon.\r\nI‚Äôm also primarily interested in the seasonal influenza vaccine,\r\nwhere most boosting events are not to novel strains, but instead to\r\nantigenically drifted strains which (in the grand scheme of things) are\r\nnot that different. Both the original source paper and the review note\r\nthat epitope masking may not explain the ability of prevaccination\r\nimmunity to an antigenically different, but similar, strain to inhibit\r\nthe formation of a novel immune response. Although it seems biologically\r\nplausible to me that the memory B cell response is playing a large role\r\nin the inhibition of a novel response.\r\nIt sort of took me all day to read this review. It is fairly dense\r\nand I kept getting interrupted by my thoughts and other things, so it\r\ntook me a while to read. So my thoughts in this post are probably quite\r\nchoppy and not super cogent. But overall, I was already aware of most of\r\nthe work that went into this review, but I am glad to have all of the\r\ninformation summarized in one place. The review also talks a lot about\r\nstem vs.¬†head antibody, but most of the data that is available to me\r\ndoes not measure stem antibody (in fact, they only measure HAI titers,\r\nwhich is another issue altogether). However, I suspect that I will be\r\nreading through this paper‚Äôs entire bibliography in the near\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast updated\r\n2022-04-08 20:01:34 EDT\r\nDetails\r\nsource\r\ncode, R\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe unique characteristics of an\r\nindividual‚Äôs immune system, like the antibody repertoire, specificity\r\nand amount of memory B cells, cytokine profiles, and so on‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\n",
